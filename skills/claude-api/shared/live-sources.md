### Anthropic CLI

The `ant` CLI provides terminal access to the Claude API. Every API resource is exposed as a subcommand. It is one convenient way to create agents, environments, sessions, and other resources from version-controlled YAML, and to inspect responses interactively.

| Topic         | URL                                                     | Extraction Prompt                                                                                  |

## Claude API SDK Repositories

WebFetch these when a binding (class, method, namespace, field) isn't covered in the cached `{lang}/` skill files or in the managed-agents docs above. The SDKs include beta managed-agents support for `/v1/agents`, `/v1/sessions`, `/v1/environments`, and related resources — search the repo for `BetaManagedAgents`, `beta.agents`, `beta.sessions`, or the equivalent namespace for that language.

| SDK        | URL                                                      | Extraction Prompt                                                                                                       |

## Fallback Strategy

If WebFetch fails (network issues, URL changed):

1. Use cached content from the language-specific files (note the cache date)
2. Inform user the data may be outdated
3. Suggest they check platform.claude.com or the GitHub repos directly
