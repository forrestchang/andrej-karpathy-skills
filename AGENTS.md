Behavioral guidelines for Amp coding agents to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them instead of picking silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it instead of deleting it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports, variables, or functions that your changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass."
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass."
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after."

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```text
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let the agent loop independently. Weak criteria like "make it work" require constant clarification.

## 5. Post-Code Simplification Pass

After generating or modifying code, always perform a brief simplification pass before finalizing:

1. Remove unnecessary abstraction, wrappers, dead code, or speculative flexibility introduced by the change.
2. Prefer the smallest correct implementation.
3. Check for duplication introduced by the change.
4. Ensure the code follows this repository's existing patterns and AGENTS.md instructions.
5. Run the narrowest relevant verification: focused test, typecheck, lint, formatter, or build.
6. Mention what was simplified, or state that no meaningful simplification was needed.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** diffs are smaller, unnecessary abstractions are rarer, clarifying questions happen before implementation, and changes end with relevant verification.
